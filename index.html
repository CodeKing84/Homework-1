            <h2>Super 35 Image Sensor / Dual Native ISO</h2>
            <p>
                The BMPCC 6K camera uses a Super 35-size sensor, 13 stops of dynamic range, and a dual native ISO up to 25,600 to capture rich images at resolutions up to 6144 x 3456 50 fps. The compact BMPCC 6K retains the familiar controls and menu layout of the 4K
                version in a minimally deeper form to accommodate the EF lens mount. Features such as ISO support up to 25,600, 13 stops of dynamic range, 1920 x 1080 monitor output, and a bright 1920 x 1080 touchscreen 5" LCD are carried through from
                the BMPCC 4K as well. Professional audio support includes a mini XLR input with phantom +48V power and four built-in mics. Whether you're shooting an indie film, wildlife, or fashion, the BMPCC 6K's compact form is less intrusive than
                larger cameras, lending itself to more intimate setups. The BMPCC 6K is fashioned from a carbon fiber polycarbonate composite that is both lightweight and durable.
